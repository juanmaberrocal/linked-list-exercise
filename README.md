### Solution

Exercise updated by Juan M Berrocal.

- Existing methods filled in
- Existing tests passing

Added:
	- List
		-- attr_accessor for :sorted attr
		-- attr_reader for :nodes (list has linked Node objects)
		-- test for "each" method 
	- Node
		-- "link" method
		-- test for "link" method

---

### Overview

This repo contains an incomplete linked list implementation, with failing tests.

You can run the tests with the following command:

```
ruby test/list_test.rb
```

A good solution will:
  - fill in the existing public methods
  - add private/protected methods as necessary, following good design principles
  - make all existing test pass
  - add additional tests if necessary
